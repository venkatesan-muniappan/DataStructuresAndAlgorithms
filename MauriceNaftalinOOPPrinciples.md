Summary

SOLID
  1. Single Responsibility for Classes, methods and interfaces.
  2. Open-Close Principle. Classes should be open for extension but closed for modifications
  3. Liskov Substitution Principle. Whereever you expect a object of type parent can be replaced with its subtypes.
  4. Interface segregation principle. Interfaces should contain as few contracts as possible so that client code doesn't have to implement methods which they are not interested
  5. Dependency Inversion Principle. Objects should be decoupled with other objects as much as possible.
