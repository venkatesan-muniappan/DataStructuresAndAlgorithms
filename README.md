This is a test repository created to practice Data structures and Algorithms concepts. In this repository I will be solving practice problems from the below topics.

## DataStructures:
* Arrays
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Hash Table & Hash Set
* Heap
* Binary Search Tree

## Algorithms:
 ### Sorting
   * Bubble Sort
   * Selection Sort
   * Insertion Sort
   * Merge Sort
   * Quick Sort
   * Heap Sort
 ### Graph
   * BFS
   * DFS
   * Prims and Kruskals (Minimum  Cost Spanning Tree)
   * Topological Sort
   * Bellman Ford
   * Floyd Warshall Algorithm
   * Dijkstra Algorithm
   * Knapsack
   * Travelling Sales Man
 ### Dynamic Programming
 ### Greedy Algorithms
 ### Backtracking
 ### Branch and bound
 ### String Algorithms
